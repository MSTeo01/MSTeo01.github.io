**ECON 148: Data Science for Economists** ([**Spring 2024**](https://www.econ148.org/sp24/))
1. Ted Miguel's Paper Reproduction
   - [Github](https://github.com/MSTeo01/Econ-148-Project-3)

**DATA 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions** ([**Spring 2024**](https://data102.org/sp24/))
1. An Investigation into the Causality of Arkansas Speed Limit Increase on Traffic Accidents and the Effect of Road Conditions on Traffic Accident Duration
   - [Report](https://msteo.org/assets/data102.pdf)


**DATA 144: Data Mining and Analytics** ([**Fall 2023**])
1. Traffic Accident Delay Prediction
   - Analyzed accident patterns in the US Traffic Accidents through EDA and built a classifier that predicts the level of delays that an accident caused.

**DATA 101: Data Engineering** ([**Fall 2023**](https://fa23.data101.org/))
1. [DB] Query Optimization (PostgreSQL)
   - Explored various query optimization techniques and learned how to further tune query performance on [Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/download-baseball-database/)
2. [DB] Data Transformation (PostgreSQL)
   - Utilized multiple data transformation techniques to clean and impute missing data on one month of sensor data from buildings at UC Berkeley [Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01257-x)
3. [DB] MongoDB
   - Compared different database systems on their handling of semi-structured JSON data using [Yelp Academic Dataset]()

**DATA 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science** ([**Spring 2023**](https://ds100.org/sp23/))<br>
1. [ML] Housing Sales Price Predictor
   - Built a linear regression model that predicts the housing prices in Cook County using feature engineering and cross-validation (500000+ entry housing database)
2. [ML] Spam Classifier
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict whether an email was spam or ham. Received a 94% accuracy on the testing set.

**DATA 8: Foundations of Data Science** ([**Fall 2022**](http://data8.org/fa22))<br>
1. [ML] Movie Genre Classifier
   - Classifies movie genres using KNN Model on common word frequencies

**DATA C88C: Computational Structures in Data Science** ([**Fall 2022**](https://c88c.org/fa22/))<br>
1. [ML] [Maps](https://c88c.org/fa22/proj/maps/)
   - Yelp Recommender. Recommends highly rated restaurants to users by categorizing restaurants by their rating. Combines basic supervised and unsupervised learning and object-oriented programming paradigms.
2. [SWE] [Ants vs. SomeBees](https://c88c.org/fa22/proj/ants/)
   - Spin off of the popular game Plants Vs. Zombies. Combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms.
  
**CS 61B: Data Structures** ([**Fall 2022**](https://fa22.datastructur.es/))<br>
1. [SWE] [Build Your Own World](https://fa22.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/)
   - Built a simple 2D game that involves random world generation with seeds, interactions between the user and the game world, a complete user interface, and other basic game features such as progress saving and visual effects.
