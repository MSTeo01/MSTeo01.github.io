## 👋 About me

Hey! I'm Ming, a current undergrad student at **UC Berkeley** going for a major in Data Science! I dedicate my time to utilizing foundational techniques of Data Science to explore the impacts of climate change, learning about the price-setting process of hospital system and making it transparent to the public.

I'm originally from Malacca, Malaysia 🇲🇾.
