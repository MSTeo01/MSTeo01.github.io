## ðŸ‘‹ About me

Hey! My name is Ming! I'm a recent Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. Iâ€™m originally from Malacca, Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.

I'm passionate about understanding the intersection of the impacts of climate change and its effects on public health. How much has our world changed environmentally and how does that affect our health and the policies that are in place to support us? Through data science, I'm fascinated by its prowess and usage which allows us to gain insight into the climate and health crisis we are facing currently and build solutions that society can utilize in the future.

Some hobbies of mine are badminton, cooking (any sort, but mostly Malaysian/Chinese cuisine), and being somewhere that's surrounded by nature.
