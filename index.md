## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hey! My name is Ming! I'm a recent Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. Iâ€™m originally from Malacca, Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾. I'm particularly interested in building products that empower data-backed decision-making. A few of my previous experiences are listed below:

- Springer Capital (Present): Currently working on automating the process of creating Power BI dashboards from hiring data designed to showcase recruiting key performance indicators.
- UC Berkeley Petris Center (Fall 2023 - Spring 2024): Utilized hospital and insurer price data to build causal inference models to identify price discrimination between certain groups of hospitals/insurers. Employed Trino to optimize query running efficiency for healthcare data.
  
I'm passionate about understanding the intersection of the impacts of climate change and its effects on public health. I often think about the environmental changes in our world and how they can impact our health and the current health policies that support us. 

Some hobbies of mine are badminton, cooking (any sort, but mostly Malaysian/Chinese cuisine), and being somewhere that's surrounded by nature.
