## ðŸ‘‹ About me

Hey! My name is Ming! I'm a recent Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley. Iâ€™m originally from Malacca, Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾.

I'm passionate about understanding the intersection of the impacts of climate change and its effects on public health. I often think about the environmental changes in our world and how they can impact our health and the current health policies that support us. 

Some hobbies of mine are badminton, cooking (any sort, but mostly Malaysian/Chinese cuisine), and being somewhere that's surrounded by nature.
