## üëã About me

Hey! My name is Ming and I'm a senior at Cal studying Data Science. I grew up in the ancient city of Malacca, Malaysia üá≤üáæ. I received my associate's degree in Math and Economics from [De Anza Community College](https://www.deanza.edu/) in 2022.

I am deeply curious about the intersection of the impacts of climate change and its effects on public health. How much has our world changed environmentally and how does that affect our health and the policies that are in place to support us? Through data science, I'm fascinated by its prowess and usage which allows us to gain insight into the climate and health crisis we are facing currently and build solutions that society can utilize in the future.

As of late, I'm part of the [California Consortium for Public Health Informatics & Technology(CCPHIT)](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/specialty-areas/public-health-informatics/) program that works on developing students in the field of public health informatics, my work sits within the intersection of health disparities and climate change. I've also working on investigating the environmental impacts of COVID-19 during the lockdowns utilizing my computative and environmental knowledge.
